Businesses increasingly use software. This is
even more relevant for companies relying on e-commerce. However,
software is error-prone and contain several bugs. Security
bugs are one of the major problems faced by
companies today. In the worst case, security bugs
enable unauthorized users to gain full control of an application.
This paper addresses the issue of finding security vulnerabilities
in applications through static taint analysis.
We present an interprocedural taint analysis for C programs,
implemented in the LLVM framework.
Our analysis comes in two flavors: a context-insensitive and
a context-sensitive version that may complement each other.
