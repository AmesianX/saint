Software vulnerabilities are security threats
that exist in an application when users may exercise
unauthorized  control of the application through supplied input.
Such unauthorized control are classified in different
categories : \textit{buffer overflow}, \textit{SQL
injection}, \textit{cross site scripting}, etc.
Taint Analysis is a popular analysis technique for
detecting security vulnerabilities in software.
We present an interprocedural taint analysis 
to detect security vulnerabilities for programs
written in the C program language. We implemented our
analysis in the LLVM framework.
