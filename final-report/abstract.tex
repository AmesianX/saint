Software vulnerabilities are security threats
that exist in an application when users may exercise
unauthorized  control of the application through supplied input.
Such unauthorized control are classified in different
categories : \textit{buffer overflow}, \textit{SQL
injection}, \textit{cross site scripting}, etc.
Both dynamic and static techniques exist to alleviate
security vulnerabilities in software. 

This project aims at using \textit{static taint analysis}
to prevent software vulnerabilities using the
LLVM framework.
