\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project report, we have presented an interprocedural
static taint analysis that comes in two flavors: a
context-insensitive and context-sensitive version.

The analysis does not handle the use of
\textit{sanitizer functions}, which would correspond
to \texttt{kill-sets} in the analysis description.
In future work, we plan to generate kill-sets at
program points whenever an adequate sanitizer is
encountered.
We also plan to handle structures and arrays in future work.

Given the staged nature of the presented analysis, and its
use of a summary table that stores newer analysis results
(i.e. new information from successive analyzes run are stored
in the summary table), we believe that an integration in IDE
would be possible.
