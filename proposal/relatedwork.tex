\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{\cite{Shankar:2001:DFS}} presents a tool to statically
detect format string vulnerabilities in C programs. Their analysis
is based on type qualifiers and type inference. Given a C program,
an initial subset of the program is annotated with the type qualifiers
\texttt{tainted} and \texttt{untainted}. The paper defines a set
of inference rules, which has a rule for each construct of
the C programming language. The inference rules are used, together
with the initial program annotations to generate type qualifier
constraints over the program. The analysis then warns the user
about a format string vulnerability whenever the program does not
type checks due to an unsatisfiable constraint. The presented tool
is built on top of the type qualifier framework \textit{CQUAL} 
\cite{Foster:pldi99}.
