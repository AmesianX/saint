\section*{Question 2: Application of Techniques from \cite{Pradel:2013:ATS}}

\newcommand{\myA}{\texttt{A}}
\newcommand{\myB}{\texttt{B}}

Given class \myA{} and its subclass \myB{} from the exam
sheet, we are going to show that class \myB{} is a
\textit{crashing substitute} of its super class \myA{}.

\paragraph*{Constructor Mapping}
Given the fact that the subclass (\myB{}) and the super
class (\myA{}) do not have the exact same types of arguments,
we define the following constructor mapping that show the
equivalence between constructor calls of \myB{} and \myB{}.

$\mathit{B}(int) \rightarrow \mathit{A}()$

\paragraph*{Test Generation}
According to
