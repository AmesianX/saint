\section*{Question 5}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This paper presents an intraprocedural analysis that detects
array accesses for which index variable checking was not done
on some paths leading to the access.

Statically verifying that programs check array index variables
before array accesses is useful at it may help developers detect
incorrect array accesses that may lead to program termination
at runtime.

EXAMPLE

Our analysis is implemented in the
Clang framework\footnote{http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/},
which is a static source code analysis tool to find bugs in
C, C++, and objective C.

The Clang analyzer performs a symbolic execution on the CFG
of the program under analysis. The analysis is path- and
context-sensitive. To comply to the clang framework, we need
to implement our analysis as a \textit{checker}.
