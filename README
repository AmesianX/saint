A. Required Tools
   --------------
   1. Poolalloc (Pointer analysis)
      https://github.com/llvm-mirror/poolalloc
      # Use the git tag '181c62f1d29ae9de660bad0a6593130d15803abc'
 
      Configuration
      -------------     
      You may use the script 'configure-llvm.sh' located
      in the folder 'scripts' to configure poolalloc before
      building it.


   2. LLVM (Version 3.3)
      http://llvm.org/releases
      
      Configuration
      ------------- 
      You may use the script 'configure-poolalloc.sh' located
      in the folder 'scripts' to configure the package.

      Pointer Analysis:
      You need to use 'poolalloc' describe in (1). One way to have
      access to the 'include' folder of poolalloc from within LLVM
      is to create a symbolic link to the 'include/dsa' folder in
      poolalloc: 
      $LLVM_HOME/build/include/dsa --> $POOL_ALLOC/include/dsa

B. Usefull Environment Variables to Set
   ------------------------------------

   1. LLVM_HOME: The root folder of your LLVM files
