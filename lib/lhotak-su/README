The directory contains an implementation of strong update subset-based
points-to analysis, a hybrid analysis providing benefits of
both flow-insensitive and flow-sensitive analyses. The strong
update analysis algorithm is described in the paper:

  Ondrej Lhotak, K.-C. Andrew Chung, "Points-To Analysis with Efficient
  Strong Updates", POPL 2011: 38th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on
  Principles of Programming Languages.

Since the analysis is an extension of a flow-insensitive analysis,
this implementation is an adaptation of the flow-insensitive
analysis implementation from the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure.
The only file changed from the LLVM 2.6 distribution is
lib/Analysis/IPA/Andersens.cpp. The file Andersens.cpp in this directory
is the modified Andersens.cpp containing the strong update analysis. For
convenience, the original Andersens.cpp from LLVM 2.6 is in the file
Andersens.cpp.orig-llvm-2.6 in this directory.
