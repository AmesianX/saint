\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}

Our analysis essentially works in two steps. The
first step consists in creating a summary for each
function.

\subsection{Summary Generation}

The summary
generation is done in reverse topological order of
the callgraph and is based on the rules given in
Table~\ref{tab:rules}.

Only one summary is generated for functions within
a strongly connected component. Such a case would be
a set of mutual recursive functions. Considering our
motivating example, this means there is a single transfer
function that summarizes functions \even{} and \odd{}.

Figure~\ref{} illustrates the summary for function
\main{} of Figure~\ref{fig:sample}

\subsection{Context-Sensitivity} 

We achieve context-sensitivity by analyzing callees
with dataflow set information of their formal parameters
at calling sites.
